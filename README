I didn't like the "mock" module, so I'm making one myself for educational purposes.

The goal is to be able to write something like this:

    class Calc(object):
        def sum(self, a, b):
            return a + b

    # 2 + 2 = 4? Not for long!
    mock = mockacino.createMock(Calc)

    mock.sum(2, 2).will_return(5)

    mockacino.replay(mock)

    assert mock.sum(2, 2) == 5 # Take that, math!

It's a work in progress.
